{e} bursts into a saloon, and bellows pridefully.  The swinging saloon door rebounds to strike them in the abdomen, slaying them instantly and demonstrating the folly of hubris.
{e} saunters along with a bowlegged gait.  They increase the bowleggedness to show swagger and fearlessness, bit by bit, until it reaches dangerous levels.  Unheeding of the audience's warnings, at last {e}'s knees give out, and they suffer a level 4 groin sproing.
{e} attempts to light a cigar using a flint and tinder.  They miss, stabbing themselves in a gland with the flint and demonstrating the cost of vice.
{e} falls into an open manhole labeled "Hubris."
{e} pauses to enjoy some delicious tobacco.  In wolfing it down greedily, they forget to chew thirty times.  They spin around choking for thirty seconds, then expire, demonstrating the mortal importance of proper food manners.
{e} roasts a tin of beans over the old campfire.  Laughing callously, they begin to eat using a salad fork instead of a beans fork. A hawk swoops down and murders them.  The audience knows that the hawk represents etiquette.
{e} makes a sport of throwing their gun up into the air.  Higher and higher it goes, and {e} catches it every time, to the gasps of the audience. However, on the sixth time, a crow catches the gun and shoots {e} four times in the gut, killing them.
{e} rides a horse to and fro, doing popular tricks such as a jump-them-up and a step-along.  They approach a flaming loop-de-loop, and {e} spurs their steed onwards, whereupon the horse shivs its rider to death.
{e} spots {c1} sauntering down an alley, and prepares to lasso them.  In their zeal, they fail to notice that their lasso is a snake, which devours them whole.  We must always be vigilant against serpents.
{e} and {c1} compete to see who has the larger belt buckle.  {c1} pretty clearly has the larger belt buckle, so {e} walks into the ocean.
{e} sips from a barrel labeled "X", then from one labeled "XX", then "3X + 5".  After tasting each carefully, they guess that X is equal to 31.  The sphinx shakes her head, frowning, and then decapitates {e}.
{e} kicks down the door to the sheriff's building, only to find that it is entirely filled with snakes.  We must always be vigilant against serpents.
{e} attaches a star to their shirt and declares themselves sheriff.  However, the weight of the star is too much, and the {e_color} cowyboy teeters before pitching over into a barrel labeled "Overambition."
{e} decides to shoot their own hat as a warning to others, walking around with a fearsome hole-filled hat.  However, the inadequate hat offers no protection from the harsh heat of the Sun, and the {e_color} cowyboy soon passes out from heatstroke.
{e} declares that they shall lasso the Sun and, in doing so, become a new God.  They throw the lasso up into the air, and after a moment, are struck in the head by the falling lasso, killing them instantly.  We must never defy the Five.

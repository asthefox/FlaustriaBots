{e} bursts into a saloon, and bellows pridefully.  The swinging saloon door rebounds to strike them in the abdomen, slaying them instantly and demonstrating the folly of hubris.
{e} saunters along with a bowlegged gait.  They increase the bowleggedness to show swagger and fearlessness, bit by bit, until it reaches dangerous levels.  Unheeding of the audience's warnings, at last {e}'s knees give out, and they suffer a level 4 groin sproing.
{e} attempts to light a cigar using a flint and tinder.  They miss, stabbing themselves in a gland with the flint and demonstrating the cost of vice.
{e} falls into an open manhole labeled "Hubris."
{e} pauses to enjoy some delicious tobacco.  In wolfing it down greedily, they forget to chew thirty times.  They spin around choking for thirty seconds, then expire, demonstrating the mortal importance of proper food manners.
{e} roasts a tin of beans over the old campfire.  Laughing callously, they begin to eat using a salad fork instead of a beans fork. A hawk swoops down and murders them.  The audience knows that the hawk represents etiquette.
{e} makes a sport of throwing their six-shooter up into the air.  Higher and higher it goes, and {e} catches it every time, to the gasps of the audience. However, on the sixth time, a crow catches the firearm and happens to shoot {e} several times in the gut, killing them.
{e} rides a horse to and fro, doing popular tricks such as a jump-them-up and a step-along.  They approach a flaming loop-de-loop, and {e} spurs their steed onwards, whereupon the horse shivs its rider to death.
{e} spots {c1} sauntering down an alley, and prepares to lasso them.  In their zeal, they fail to notice that their lasso is a snake, which devours them whole.  We must always be vigilant against serpents.
{e} and {c1} compete to see who has the larger belt buckle.  {c1} pretty clearly has the larger belt buckle, so {e} walks into the ocean.
{e} sips from a barrel labeled "X", then from one labeled "XX", then "3X + 5".  After tasting each carefully, they guess that X is equal to 31.  The sphinx shakes her head, frowning, and then decapitates {e}.
{e} kicks down the door to the sheriff's building, only to find that it is entirely filled with snakes.  We must always be vigilant against serpents.
{e} attaches a star to their shirt and declares themselves sheriff.  However, the weight of the star is too much, and the {e_color} cowyboy teeters before pitching over into a barrel labeled "Overambition."
{e} decides to shoot their own hat as a warning to others, walking around with a fearsome hole-filled hat.  However, the inadequate hat offers no protection from the harsh heat of the Sun, and the {e_color} cowyboy soon passes out from heatstroke.
{e} declares that they shall lasso the Sun and, in doing so, become a new God.  They throw the lasso up into the air, and after a moment, are struck in the head by the falling lasso, killing them instantly.  We must never defy the Five.
{e} is roasting sugar candies over a fire, and as {c1} approaches, offers to share them.  An armadillo approaches, and steals {e}'s boot, for it is clear that the {e_color} cowyboy does not respect the value of private property in a way observant of The Market.  {e} laments their lost boot, and collapses dramatically.
In a back alley, {e} attempts to use witchcraft to summon a demonic entity that might strike their foes.  As they put in the final ingredient, the summoning circle is filled with a puff of smoke and a woosh of malign purple light.  Then, before {e}'s eyes, a lit stick of TNT appears and blows them up.
{e} slouches louchely against a wall.  They slide further down the wall as they slouch further, then totally wipe out.
Glancing around scornfully, {e} winds up and hawks a spit onto the dusty ground.  In response to this act of littering, The Sun "spits" a pillar of fire from the sky upon {e}, and the {e_color} cowyboy is gone without a trace.
{e} comes across a shiny golden coin lying under a series of precarious crates and unstable explosives.  The {e_color} cowyboy thinks about picking it up, but decides to just keep walking.  The audience gasps at this sinful affront to The Market.  They are not surprised when the clever {c1} picks up the coin, exchanges it for an upgrade, and uses their new homing lasso to take out {e}.
{e} hides inside a barrel.  They snicker, holding up a highly illegal rattle with which they intend to give any unlucky passersby a scare.  Soon, {c1} walks by, and {e} thrice shakes the rattle in the style of a deadly serpent.  The barrel is immediately swarmed by a battalion of mongooses, and when the dust clears, the barrel and {e} alike are gone.
{e} gnaws on a heel of bread, while a small mammal approaches.  The {e_color} cowyboy shoos the animal away, failing to notice that it is a most holy mongoose.  {e} finishes the bread and walks away whistling, at which point a giant snake pops out of the Sheriff's office to devour them.
A barrel shakes ominously.  Once, twice, three times.  {e} cautiously moves to investigate, and opens the barrel to reveal a great geyser.  The onrushing water knocks {e} through the doors of the saloon, as well as delighting the audience in the "Splash Zone."
{e} challenges {c1} to a wrestling match, questioning their cowyboy credentials.  The two circle, and exchange words.  {e} goes in for a lariat, but {c1} ducks, catches the arm, and counters with an Emerald Frosion for the three-count.
{c1} challenges {e} to a wrestling match, questioning their cowyboy credentials.  The two circle, and words.  {c1} goes in for a big kick, but {e} manages to catch their foot.  However, {c1} spins around and hits them with an enzuigiri, then lifts the staggered {e} into a Michinoku Driver, holding on for the three-count.
{c1} and {e} engage in a duel.  {e} tosses their lasso, but {c1} dodges.  Then, {c1} spins their own lasso faster and faster, twirling it so fast that it creates a cyclone that sweeps across the dusty street and sends {e} toppling into the sky.
{e} challenges {c1} to a harmonica battle.  {c1} plays an impressive 22 notes, but {e} counters by playing an astounding 35 notes.  {c1} objectively wins.
{c1} challenges {e} to a harmonica battle.  {c1} plays an impressive 22 notes, and {e} can only match by feebly playing 16 notes.  {c1} objectively wins.
{e} stands in the dusty road.  The children of the audience shout and point, warning that a tumpleweed is fast approaching!  {e} fails to notice, and gets wung in the face by the tumpleweed.
In the saloon, {e} downs another beverage and challenges {c1} to a duel using their Drunken Boxing technique.  {c1} counters with their Unimpaired Reaction Time Boxing technique, winning with relative ease.
{e} rides off into the sunset, sacrificing their mortal form to The Sun's holy fire so that it might burn even brighter.  The audience applauds this pious act, but {e} has given up their chances of winning the duel.
{e} moseys down the dusty street, but steps into a patch of quickdust and soon disappears into the ground below.
{e} hovers over a cauldron, preparing to sacrifice some Venom of Cat in order to cast a dire hex upon {c1}.  However, much like the illegal witch's heart, the reagent is impure, and the hex backfires.  {e} becomes severely allergic to owls, and their fine owlskin hat ironically becomes their undoing.
{e} sneaks up on a horse, and cruelly steals its blinders, donning them and declaring that they now have the power of a horse.  {c1} approaches from the side and cold-cocks {e}.
{e} wanders far from the lone saloon and the dusty street, roaming further and further afield until they come face-to-face with one of Porpoise Bay's famous roller coasters.  Suddenly, {e} realizes that they are in a stage show.  After several minutes moment of shock and trepidation, they find the bravery to step out into the world beyond the stage.  {e} purchases a churro.
